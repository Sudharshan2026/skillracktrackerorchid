### Changed
- Sonner component now uses CSS class-based theme detection (removed next-themes dependency)
- App.tsx now renders Sonner Toaster component for global toast notifications
- ThemeToggle now uses document.documentElement.classList for theme switching
- HomePage now uses toast notifications instead of inline error displays
- All component CSS files now use design system tokens for consistency

### Technical Improvements
- Improved code consistency across CSS files
- Better maintainability through design system tokens
- Enhanced accessibility with proper ARIA labels
- Better performance with optimized transitions
- Improved developer experience with consistent patterns

### Changed - SkillRack Scraping Logic Migration (2025-10-05)
- Deprecated Vercel API scraping: The scraping logic in `api/parse-profile.ts` is now disabled and returns a deprecation message.
- Client-side scraping migration: SkillRack profile scraping is now performed in the browser using a CORS proxy (see `plan.md`).
- Frontend will fetch profile HTML via a proxy (e.g., `https://api.allorigins.win/raw?url=...`) and parse it using browser APIs.
- This change bypasses Cloudflare blocks and improves reliability for deployed users.
