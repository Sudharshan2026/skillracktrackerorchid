## Technical Implementation Details

### CSS Architecture
```css
/* Mobile-first approach */
.component {
  /* Base mobile styles */
}

@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .component {
    /* Tablet and up styles */
  }
}

@media (min-width: 1024px) {
  .component {
    /* Desktop styles */
  }
}
```

### Touch Detection
```css
@media (hover: none) and (pointer: coarse) {
  /* Touch device specific styles */
  .button:active {
    transform: scale(0.98);
  }
}
```

### iOS Optimization
```css
input, textarea, select {
  font-size: 16px; /* Prevent zoom */
  -webkit-appearance: none; /* Remove default styling */
}

body {
  -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch; /* Smooth scrolling */
}
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Test on iPhone (portrait and landscape)
- [ ] Test on Android phone (portrait and landscape)
- [ ] Test on iPad (portrait and landscape)
- [ ] Test on desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [ ] Verify touch targets are at least 44px × 44px
- [ ] Confirm inputs don't cause zoom on iOS
- [ ] Check horizontal scrolling works smoothly
- [ ] Verify all text is readable at different sizes

### Browser DevTools Testing
1. Open Chrome DevTools
2. Toggle device toolbar (Ctrl+Shift+M)
3. Test various device presets
4. Verify responsive breakpoints
5. Check touch simulation

### Responsive Test Page
A test page (`responsive-test.html`) is included to verify:
- Breakpoint indicators
- Touch target sizes
- Form input behavior
- Grid layout responsiveness

## Browser Support

### Fully Supported
- Chrome 90+
